# Plant Village Disease Detection

In  this  projecy   we  modeled  the multi-class   classification   of   various   plant   diseases over  2  different  datasets:  PlantVillage  and  PlantDoc,  by  using various  pre-trained  models  like  VGG16,  Xception,  InceptionV3,ResNet152, MobileNetV2. We have also analyzed the drawbacksand  effectiveness  of  each  dataset  and  its  producibility  for  usingthem  in  real-time  detection  systems  which  can  be  beneficial  inreducing  losses  that  we  face  because  of  disease  outbreaks.
